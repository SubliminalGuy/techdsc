## Technological Sovereignty - Introduction - the big picture/vision 

We live in societies in which technological systems and the ways in which they are shaped and governed are powerful ways to shape society. Technology has become a central form of social power and it is urgent to democratise this power. Technological changes have been accelerating and the private sector has an increasing influence over the directions of these changes. However, it is becoming ever more clear that the concentration of capital driven technological change is detrimental to the flourishing of people and a healthy democracy. 

Democratising societies must include democratising its technologies. And democratising technologies can only be successful within an agenda to democratise societies. Digitalisation, energy and mobility systems, housing, the future of work, of our health, of freedom, of equality, of our public sphere, of cities, of the environment and of states and democracy – the shape and quality of all of this is entwined with technological changes. Combining the democratisation of societies with the democratisation of technologies is therefore not only about the need to regulate particular technologies to prevent harm. Democratising technology is about finding ways of democratically shaping and governing technologies for the common good, to bring technological power under democratic control and to use technological advances to benefit the many and to help societies and people flourish in the 21st century. 

### The undemocratic state of current technological change in Europe

The concentration of technological power, often in corporations, that translates into economic, political and cultural influence and directs the benefits of new technologies towards the few, the shareholders and capital owners. This is tightly entangled with financialised capitalism where investors shape technological change purely on a for maximum profit basis. 

The privatisation of knowledge and data, which monopolises collectively created ideas, capabilities, information and resources and feeds a regime of surveillance capitalism where data is "valuable" for creating tools to manipulate consumers. 

The extreme centralisation and concentration of influence over the World Wide Web, one of the most significant infrastructures of our society, through corporations and states. 

The technocratic decision making in research and politics where experts make decisions about shaping the future through research and innovation in intransparent and unaccountable ways. 

The narrow focus on "high-tech" technological innovation and economic growth that leaves out of sight social and cultural innovations and innovations that may not lead to maximum profit but to social well-being and significant ecological sustainability. 

The lack of diversity of people who do research, development and decision making in technology.

We propose policies that help to democratically shape the technologies that are such an important part of our lives, economies and societies. We propose to make use of the power of the public sector and of civil society to seed innovations and unleash their potential for social good.

### Towards technologies for the common good 

Technological development is not a goal in itself. Technology exists to serve human progress. DiEM25 firmly supports human rights in the face of technology – the flourishing of humans, all humans, comes first, and technology second. Conceived in this way, technological development can be a formidable force for good. Technology is a key contributor to our civilization’s ability to provide health, welfare, social interaction, freedom, safety and happiness. DiEM25 firmly supports sound and positive technological development that benefits mankind, and rejects Luddite anti-technological thinking. However, this does not mean that all technological development is good. And negative costs and consequences of technologies must be taken into account - it must no longer be the case that profits from new technologies are privatised and the risks are socialised. In the face of accelerating technological change we need to safeguard and extend our individual and collective self-determination to not lose control to the designers and owners of technological systems or even autonomous technological systems themselves. 

Every technological development is the result of choices. Choices made by governments, researchers, investors, consumers, manufacturers, distributors, users and many others. No technology is god-given or given by the "invisible hand of the market". No technology is unavoidable or unopposable. And no technology is neutral. DiEM25 believes that, as a society, we have the duty to be aware of the fact that we make choices on technology. Technology is therefore never value-free. The way we fund, adopt, use and regulate technology, or not, reflects society’s choice of its values and priorities. That is a reflection of our society’s priorities and values. We must be more aware of how choices around technology are rooted in values, and openly discuss and decide on them in a democratic way. The agenda setting of the debate around technology and values should be open, and not set by the technology industry itself. The necessary democratic instruments and institutions, capable to address the complexities of the democratisation of 21st century technologies, must be found. 

Every technology is the result of collaboration. Collaboration between developers, public institutions, users, researchers and more. Innovative societies foster collaborations. And they have public institutions and investments that foster the exchange of ideas and provide resources for the new to emerge - technologies depend on the public. For too long have regulations from the time of the first industrial revolution and power structures aided in monopolising and privatising technology. Artificial boundaries that block or slow down the creative sharing of technology damage society. The more value and technology are shared; the more they can create value in return. By sharing technology and knowledge, society ensures that much more value is created than by “protecting” it. DiEM25 firmly supports sharing technology, and rejects monopolies or rent seeking. With the growing importance of technological systems in the creation of value we need to devise ways to share the benefits of technology to all of society and to use it as a way to improve the lives of the many and not further boost the wealth of the few.

Which sub-chapters do we need and what is their story that ties into the larger story? =

How do we select and order the proposals in their "importance" for the policies? => question for us drafting it and for the feedback process... 

### Chapter proposal: A common internet of free people/ A free European Internet of digital commons/ 

#### European Data/Platform Autonomy

Those who are old enough to have experienced the INTERNET in the late 1990ies will remember how radical it felt to have a decentralized (rhizomatic) network of interconnected computers unaffected by the hegemonic discourse of traditional media outlets and arbitrary governmental control. This INTERNET and its accompanying promise of a new, progressive age of unlimited and uncontrolled communication is long gone. As a german proverbial phrase puts it: every radical and progressive movement will eventually end up as a bratwurst shack. But it is worse: the INTERNET has become a medieval marketplace where everyone is keen to sacrifice safety, responsibility and sustainability for a quick dime. Or as Cory Doctorow puts it: 

> "dossiers on billions of people hold the power to wreak almost  unimaginable harm, and yet, each dossier brings in just a few dollars a year. For commercial surveillance to be cost effective, it has to  socialize all the risks associated with mass surveillance and privatize all the gains."

We think that the progressive version of the INTERNET doesn't need to remain a nostalgic memory. In the last 20 years technologies and concepts have been developed that'll allow to facilitate a democratic, decentralized, less-commercialized, secure, anonymous and encrypted INTERNET. An INTERNET free of waylaying villains, glass bead traders and quack doctors but rather related to 21st century social and ethical standards. 

We are thinking about an evolutionary boost for the INTERNET which we want to achieve not primarily by regulations and law amendments but by publicly funded and facilitated structures that will allow european citizens to switch sides. And that will be there as a safety net when the old INTERNET has been altered unusable or unaffordable. 

The structures proposed on the following pages will also implement a reasonable business model to attract private investors without sacrificing the safety and data autonomy of the user/citizens.

#### European Autonomous Data Network

The basic structure for our next level INTERNET will be the European Autonomous Data Network (EADN). By proposing this we identify the centralized structure of the INTERNET as a main issue for its current deformation. Contemporary cloud computer services are oligopolistic, unsecure and privately controlled structural nodes that are harvesting our data. At the same time this centralized server structure provides a ready-made framework for government surveillance. 

TL;DR: We are not safe on company servers.

As a solution we propose a decentralized, anonymous, autonomous, encrypted peer-to-peer-network. Think of a gigantic network of personal computers, tablets and smartphones helping to organize, structure and maintain a serverless and decentralized network. This network creates itself automatically with the initial help of bootstrap servers provided by the European Union. The data is stored on hardware and uses bandwith provided by users of the network. All data on this network is fragmented (split up into pieces of e.g. 1 MByte) and encrypted to ensure its safety and integrity. Popular Data us being spreaded increasingly to the physical location where it is required. No client has a complete overview over the network and thus the bigger the network becomes, the more secure it will get. To incentivize users to provided hardware and bandwidth there will be the option to implement a micropayment system (e.g. using a blockchain secured virtual currency).

To establish this European Autonomous Data Network we propose a European Save Networking Fund set up by the EU that funds research on an open-source and easy-to-use solution implementing the specifications mentioned above.

Furthermore we propose that the EU provides bootstrap servers and a minimum amount of storage capacity (storing encrypted data chunks) to get the network up and running.

### Chapter proposal: An innovative and democratic public sector in Europe/ Funding the technologies we need/ 

Story / tagline: Knowledge builds more knowledge

Joren principles #5 + #7

Main topics:

* Promoting free & open source software (incl. institutional adoption, IP reform, public funding...)
* Funding research for the public good & ensuring it's publicly available (open access)
* Supporting technology education

---

Our technology is the result of collaboration and co-operation between many, built on the knowledge developed and shared by previous generations. It is our responsibility to future generations to ensure that knowledge is not closed off, but actively supported, freely circulated, and made accesible to all. 

* **Promotion of free and open source software** In addition to providing crucial alternatives to commercial software, open source software constitutes a vast ecosystem of decentralized intellectual labor, in which anyone with an internet connection can learn from and contribute to countless community-managed codebases, and anyone can independently verify claims about the functionality of the resulting systems. This invaluable forum should be strengthened and supported by measures such as:
	* Securing funding for maintenance of crucial open source infrastructure
	* Requiring public institutions adopt open source software instead of commercial
	* Explore methods to increase the sustainability and diversity of the open source community
* **Reform of Intellectual Property / Patent law**  
* **Open Access for academic publications**
* **Public funding / citizen crowdsourcing for innovative research**


### Chapter proposal: Technological autonomy is for everyone

Story / tagline: Technological autonomy is not a privilege for platform owners, but a right for all

Rebalancing the distribution of technological autonomy

Topics covered:

* Autonomy and dignity for labor under technology (platform workers, support for cooperative platform ownership, [cf. trevor schultz], labor intelligence...)
* Diversity and inclusion - ensuring tech sector includes and serves historically marginalized groups
* Accessibility for tech users of different backgrounds 
* Algorthmic accountability / rights w/r/t AI

---

Technological autonomy - the ability to use technology for your own ends, with full confidence that it is working *for* you, and not against you - is unevenly distributed: 
CEOs of large companies take extensive measures to protect their own privacy while their workers on the job are subjected to surveillance and threatened with automation; 
able-bodied white men experience user interfaces designed for their needs, while women [struggle to obtain crucial information on reproductive health](https://www.salon.com/2016/01/29/siri_find_me_an_abortion_provider_apples_weird_anti_choice_glitch_is_finally_on_its_way_out/), people of color [experience offensively biased and faulty facial recognition](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384632/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-racial-bias-audit-data), and people with disabilities [lack support for basic accessibility to the internet](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/29/disabled-people-internet-extra-costs-commission-scope);
engineers silently collect data from unsuspecting citizens, and the algorithms built on this data are in turn deployed on citizens [without transparency or disclosure](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/11/google-duplex-ai-identify-itself-as-robot-during-calls).

Technological autonomy is today a privilege enjoyed by the few, but in a just society, it would be a right exercised by all.


* **Autonomy for workers** 
	* Restrict abusive technological practices on the job, e.g. monitoring/surveillance
	* Ensure protections for material security of platform workers +/ support cooperative models of ownership for platforms
	* Fund research on cooperative intelligence / approaches to automation that maintain worker dignity
* **Autonomy for marginalized identities**
	* Promote diversity and inclusion in technology
	* Ensure accessbility to technology for elderly and disabled
	* Audit algorithms for bias in outcomes
* **Autonomy for citizens**
	* Rights w/r/t AI (e.g. [this proposal](https://github.com/kmccurdy/techdsc/wiki/2017-07-17-Proposal:-Algorithmic-Accountability))
	* ? Rights w/r/t data ?

### Chapter proposal: Data autonomy / ownership

Story / tagline: Your data belongs to you / our data belongs to us

As discussed, this is a big topic. Could be combined with the current proposed first chapter?

Topics:

* Right to know who is using your data, and revoke access 

### Chapter proposal: Democratic technologies 

Also might be combined with current proposed first chapter?

Topics: Technologies enabling democratic participation, e.g. online voting, liquid democracy, etc...
